```

## Problem

If, like me, you're lucky enough to work with a lot of data that arrives in the form of excel tables, you will most likely be familiar with data in the format below.

This format makes it easier for a human eye to read the data, but seriously hinders a computers ability to analyse it. So, if you prefer anaylsing and visualising your data with a programming language rather than staring at it in Excel we're going to need to knock it into a _tidier_ form before we can let the powers of R loose on it.

That means one column for each variable and one row for each observation of said variables. For this sample data set I would define that as columns for:

- `ID` 
- `DATE` 
- `WEEKDAY` 
- `TIME` 
- `GROUP` 
- `METRIC1` 
- `METRIC2` 
- `METRIC3`

Currently we have the metrics for each group spread out over 3 chunks with the group indicated by a top header (only in the first column of that group) and the metric headers below. Adding fuel to the fire, in the first chunk of columns you'll notice the `ID` and `WEEKDAY` columns are floating up in row one with the others down in row 2 - nice.

A data frame in R can only take one set of column names that must be unique from each other so we need a method of reducing these headers into a single row of unique names by merging the group and metric information together with a separator. So group 1's metric columns will be named `GROUP1_METRIC1` `GROUP1_METRIC2` `GROUP1_METRIC3` and so forth for each group.

## Solution

So let's give it a go. These are the packages required:

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(readxl)
library(hms) # to convert datetimes to hms class
library(zoo) # for the super useful na.locf0 function
```

If we read all of the data with `read_excel` what do we get?

```{r}
path <- "../../static/my_data.xlsx"
raw_data <- read_excel(path)
raw_data
```

a mess.

The first row has been set as the column names with blank names assinged as `X__*` by `readxl`. Also every column has a character class because the second row headers have been considered as data.

---

## Building our own column names with code

So before attempting to actually read in the data lets try to form the single set of column names we need. To do this, I'm going to first get the headers in row 1 as a character vector and replace the missing column name pattern `X__*` with an `NA`.

Like so:

```{r}
head1 <- read_excel(path, col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  names() %>% 
  str_replace("X__\\d*", NA_character_)

head1
```

To do the same for the headers in row 2 we do the same thing but add a `skip = 1` argument to `read_excel` which tells it to ignore the first row entirely.

```{r}
head2 <- read_excel(path, skip = 1, col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  names() %>% 
  str_replace("X__\\d*", NA_character_)
head2
```

Because we had non-unique column names in this case `read_excel` has assinged some `__*` patterns to the metric names which we also want to get rid of.

```{r}
head2 <- head2 %>% str_remove("__\\d*")
head2
```

To deal with the rogue `ID` and `WEEKDAY` columns that were in row 1 with nothing below in row 2, we want to move them from `head1` into `head2` then replace with `NA` in `head1`

```{r}
ncols <- length(head1)

for (n in 1:ncols) {
  if (is.na(head2[n])) {
    head2[n] <- head1[n]
    head1[n] <- NA_character_
  }
}

head1
head2
```

Getting there! Next we need to fill out each group name so that it occurs 3 times to match each metric, rather than just once. To do this we can convert the vector to a 1 column tibble or data frame then use the `zoo::na.locf0()` that replaces `NA`s with nearest non-`NA` above it, then pull it back into a vector.

```{r}
head1 <- tibble(head1) %>% 
  mutate(head1 = zoo::na.locf0(head1)) %>% 
  pull()

head1
```

We're finally at the stage where we can combine the headers. Using `map_chr` we can ask R to merge headers with a `_` separator _only_ if there is a non-`NA` in `head1` _and_ `head2`, otherwise we only need the `head2` name. 

```{r}
headers <- map_chr(1:ncols, ~ {
  case_when(
    !is.na(head1[.x]) & !is.na(head2[.x]) ~ paste(head1[.x], head2[.x], sep = "_"),
    TRUE ~ head2[.x]
  )
})

headers
```

`r emo::ji("raised_hands")`

---

## Import the data with new headers

Now we can read in the data, ignore both header rows and supply our own column names to `read_excel`

```{r}
raw_data <- read_excel(path, skip = 2, col_names = headers)

raw_data
```

---

## Tidy the data

Now to tidy the data into our desired columns listed above, we use the `gather`, `separate`, `spread` method.

```{r}
# get index of first column that contains metric data
mcol1 <- which(str_detect(headers, "METRIC")) %>% first()

tidy_data <- raw_data %>% 
  gather(KEY, VALUE, mcol1:ncols) %>% 
  separate(KEY, into = c("GROUP", "METRIC"), sep = "_") %>% 
  spread(METRIC, VALUE) %>% 
  mutate(DATE = as.Date(DATE), TIME = as.hms(TIME)) # reclass for nicer printing

tidy_data
```

---

## Go berserk with your tidy data

Now we can do cool stuff like this...

```{r}
# average of each metric by group
tidy_data %>% 
  group_by(GROUP) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(contains("METRIC")), mean) 
```

and this...

```{r}
ggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = METRIC1, y = METRIC2, colour = GROUP)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = METRIC3))
```

That's all for now. Give me a shout if you have any questions or suggested improvements.
