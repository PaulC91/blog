Hello! I'm Paul and this is a personal blog to document my forays into all things R, data & visualisation.

Originally from Edinburgh, Scotland, I graduated with an MA in Applied Economics from the University of St Andrews in 2013.

I'm now working for data consultancy <a href="https://cultureofinsight.com/" target="_blank">Culture of Insight</a> in London as an analyst, R programmer and shiny developer.

Feel free to get in touch via any of the channels below. You can check out some of my work on the [blog page](/blog/), [projects page](/projects/), or over on the Culture of Insight [blog](https://cultureofinsight.com/blog/). 

We're always looking to get involved in new data projects at Culture of Insight, so if you're interested in working together, shoot us a note [here](https://cultureofinsight.com/contact/).

Cheers!
