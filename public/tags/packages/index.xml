      <description>I’ve been using R &amp;amp; shiny for a couple of years now. By default, that means I’ve been taking advantage of the countless open-source packages provided by the generous community of R developers. The ever-growing number of packages is making it possible to do just about anything you’d want to with R which is making someone like myself’s job easier and easier every day - so thanks to all the package developers for their efforts!</description>
